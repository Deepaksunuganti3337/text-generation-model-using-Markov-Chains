# text-generation-model-using-Markov-Chains
I. ABSTRACT
This project implements a text generation model using
Markov Chains. By training a Markov chain model on a
dataset of classic literature, the system is able to generate
coherent sequences of text based on n-gram statistics. The
primary goal is to understand how probabilistic modeling can
be used to generate text by predicting the likelihood of the
next word given a sequence of previous words. The project
demonstrates the basics of Markov Chains, applies smoothing
to handle unseen word transitions, and experiments with
different n-gram sizes to assess the quality of the generated
text.

II. INTRODUCTION
Text generation is a popular application of probabilistic
models and machine learning algorithms. It has various appli-
cations, such as generating poetry, automatic text completion,
and chatbot responses. One of the simpler models used for
text generation is the Markov Chain, a statistical model that
predicts the next state in a sequence based on the current state.
In the context of text generation, this translates into predicting
the next word based on a sequence of previous words.

III. PROBLEM STATEMENT
The problem addressed by this project is generating coher-
ent and meaningful text sequences from an initial seed using
a Markov Chain. The challenge lies in building a model that
captures the relationships between words effectively, given that
the model has limited context (i.e., it only looks at the previous
few words to predict the next one)

V. METHODOLOGY
Data Collection: Gather a suitable text corpus. This can
include books, articles, transcripts, or any text source relevant
to your projectâ€™s theme. Ensure that the data is extensive
enough to capture the patterns and probabilities needed for
text generation. Data Preprocessing: Convert all text to low-
ercase to ensure uniformity. Tokenization: Break down the
text into smaller units (words or characters). Remove any
unwanted characters, such as punctuation (optional, depending
on whether you want to include punctuation in your generated
text). Create a list of words or n-grams (e.g., pairs of words
for a second-order Markov Chain). Define States: In a Markov
Chain, each state represents a word or a sequence of words
(n-grams). Calculate Transition Probabilities: For each word
(or n-gram), calculate the probability of transitioning to the
next word in the sequence. Create a Transition Matrix where
each row represents a word and each column represents the
possible next words. Training the Model: Use the transition
matrix to train your Markov Chain model. The training in-
volves populating the matrix with probabilities based on the
frequencies in the text. Order of the Model: First-order Markov
Chain: Only considers the current word to predict the next word. 
Text Generation: Starting Point: Choose a starting word
or phrase, either randomly or from a predefined list. Text
Generation Process: Use the trained Markov Chain model to
predict the next word based on the current state. Append
the predicted word to the sequence. Update the state (e.g.,
shift to the next word for a first-order model). Repeat until
the generated text reaches the desired length or encounters a
termination condition (like a period). Evaluation : Use metrics
like Perplexity to measure the uncertainty of the model in
predicting the next word. Compare generated text to real text
using similarity measures (e.g., BLEU score).

VIII. FUTURE WORK
Hybrid Models: Combining Markov Chains with deep learn-
ing models (e.g., LSTM or GPT) to improve long-range co-
herence. Exploring Unsupervised Learning: Reducing depen-
dency on labeled data for training Markov models. Efficiency
Improvements: Optimizing the generation process for large-
scale datasets and real-time applications.

IX. CONCLUSION
First-order Markov Chains, where each word depends only
on the previous one, are computationally efficient but limitedin 
generating coherent, fluent text. They often produce repet-
itive, contextually weak output and struggle with maintaining
long-range dependencies. While suitable for simple or short
text generation, they fall short in tasks requiring more complex
language structures. As for the **BLEU score**, first-order
Markov Chains typically yield lower results due to their
limited context, matching fewer reference n-grams compared
to more advanced models. Thus, while they work well for basic
applications, more sophisticated models are better suited for
generating high-quality, contextually rich text.
